# Alert-System

## This GUI application does the following:
- Creates a window with a canvas for visualization and a label for displaying alerts.
- Simulates 7 radars placed around a port crane.
- Simulates radar detections and crane movement.
- Visualizes the crane, radar positions, and detected objects.
- Displays alerts when objects are detected within a certain range.

## To use this application:
- Install PyQt5 if you haven't already: pip install PyQt5
- Run the script.

## The application features:
- A visual representation of the 7 radars (blue dots) and the crane (black line).
- Red lines indicating radar detections.
- An alert system that displays warnings when objects are detected too close to the crane.
- Simulated crane movement and random object detections.

## Future TODO or WIP enhancements:
- Replace the simulated data with real radar input from your system.
- Adjust the radar positions, crane dimensions, and alert thresholds to match the actual setup.
- Implement more sophisticated collision detection algorithms.
- Add controls for manually adjusting the crane position and arm angle.
- Implement a more detailed visualization of the vessel and storage tanks.
- Add logging functionality to record alerts and crane movements.
- Implement different alert levels based on the proximity and nature of detected objects.
- Add sound alerts for critical warnings.
- Implement a zoom feature to focus on specific areas of the visualization.
- Add a control panel for adjusting simulation parameters or switching between real and simulated data.

This application provides a starting point for visualizing and managing alerts from multiple radars in a port crane system. One can further customize and expand its functionality based on your specific requirements and the characteristics of your radar and crane systems.
