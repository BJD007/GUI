This GUI application does the following:
Creates a window with a canvas for visualization and a label for displaying alerts.
Simulates radar detections of persons inside a car.
Visualizes the car, radar positions, and detected persons.
Displays alerts when persons are detected within a certain range.
To use this application:
Install PyQt5 if you haven't already: pip install PyQt5
Run the script.
The application features:
A visual representation of the car and two radars (blue dots) on the sides.
Red lines and circles indicating radar detections of persons.
An alert system that displays warnings when persons are detected within a certain range.
To improve and customize this application for your specific use case, consider the following enhancements:
Replace the simulated data with real radar input from your system.
Adjust the radar positions, car dimensions, and alert thresholds to match your actual setup.
Implement more sophisticated person detection algorithms.
Add controls for manually adjusting the car position and size.
Implement a more detailed visualization of the passageway and surrounding environment.
Add logging functionality to record alerts and car movements.
Implement different alert levels based on the proximity and nature of detected objects.
Add sound alerts for critical warnings.
Implement a zoom feature to focus on specific areas of the visualization.
Add a control panel for adjusting simulation parameters or switching between real and simulated data.
This application provides a starting point for visualizing and managing alerts from radars detecting persons inside a car. You can further customize and expand its functionality based on your specific requirements and the characteristics of your radar and car systems.
