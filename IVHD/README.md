# IVHD

## This GUI application does the following:
- Creates a window with a canvas for visualization and a label for displaying alerts.
- Simulates radar detections of persons inside a car.
- Visualizes the car, radar positions, and detected persons.
- Displays alerts when persons are detected within a certain range.

## To use this application:
- Install PyQt5 if you haven't already: pip install PyQt5
- Run the script.

## The application features:
- A visual representation of the car and two radars (blue dots) on the sides.
- Red lines and circles indicating radar detections of persons.
- An alert system that displays warnings when persons are detected within a certain range.

## Future TODO or WIP enhancements:
- Replace the simulated data with real radar input from your system.
- Adjust the radar positions, car dimensions, and alert thresholds to match the actual setup.
- Implement more sophisticated person detection algorithms.
- Add controls for manually adjusting the car position and size.
- Implement a more detailed visualization of the passageway and surrounding environment.
- Add logging functionality to record alerts and car movements.
- Implement different alert levels based on the proximity and nature of detected objects.
- Add sound alerts for critical warnings.
- Implement a zoom feature to focus on specific areas of the visualization.
- Add a control panel for adjusting simulation parameters or switching between real and simulated data.

This application provides a starting point for visualizing and managing alerts from radars detecting persons inside a car. One can further customize and expand its functionality based on the specific requirements and the characteristics of the radar and car systems.
